The chances are more often the higher you go… but, wonderful prizes await throughout the tower! The Pokemon here begin friendly and playful, though their idea of playful might include directing you towards a pocket of clouds ready to disperse. Then, it’s back to the beginning with you! \n\nPlayful turns solemn as you ascend, however, and some of the cloud formations remind you of angels, stone – large relics to remember the fallen. These clouds do not disperse, but when touched, your hand passes through them unlike the solid clouds beneath."
